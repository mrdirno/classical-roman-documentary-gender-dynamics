  "cover_prompt": "A Roman man and woman stand in a private tablinum study, their bodies close yet rigidly formal, their hands not touching but positioned over a wax tablet and a heavy coin purse on a marble ledger desk, a silent negotiation frozen in the tension between legal contract and personal alliance. The scene is rich with contrasting details: austere legal scrolls and a single, vivid fresco of Venus on the wall, the harsh daylight from the atrium illuminating dust motes and the profound space between them, all within the intimate, architecturally precise confines of a wealthy domus. Rendered in the atmospheric and psychologically charged style of John William Waterhouse, with the classical precision of Lawrence Alma-Tadema, capturing the texture of draped wool stolas, polished marble, and warm candlelight against cool stone. Book cover framing, a centered but asymmetrical composition viewed from a low, dramatic angle that emphasizes the towering architecture and the intimate distance between the figures, their faces a mask of public composure over private calculation. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with a split color palette of warm amber candlelight on the figures against cool, shadowed slate and marble blues, highlighting the gold of the coins and the pale wax of the tablet. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
